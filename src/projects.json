            "The purpose of our application is to merge two seperate API's (Application Program Interface) so the user can have access to detailed information, from the movie/tv show down to the very album information that is present within the movie. We took this concept and utilized the Spotify API and Movie/TV Show DB API to interact with each in our code. The goal was to display the data from each individual API through the users click interaction.",
